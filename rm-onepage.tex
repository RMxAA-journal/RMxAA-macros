Given that you only have one page, you probably don't want to waste
space with frivolities such as section headings.  

The general structure of the flow variables along the symmetry axis of
the bowshock shell is illustrated schematically in
Figure~\ref{fig:simple}.  The approximately isothermal proplyd flow
accelerates from the sound speed up to a Mach number $\mathcal{M}_0$
at the position of the shock. If the number density and temperature
immediately before the shock are $N_0$, $T_0$, then the
Rankine-Hugoniot conditions give the values immediately after
the shock to be (Landau \& Lifschitz 1987)
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mjump}
  \mathcal{M}_1 = \left( \frac{ \mathcal{M}_0^2 + 3 } { 5
      \mathcal{M}_0^2 - 1 } \right)^{1/2} , 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:njump}
  N_1 = \frac{ 4 } { 1 + 3 \mathcal{M}_0^{-2} } N_0 , 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:tjump}
  T_1 = \frac{1}{16} \left( 5 \mathcal{M}_0^2 - 1 \right) 
  \left( 1 + 3 \mathcal{M}_0^{-2} \right) T_0 .
\end{equation}
For instance, using $\mathcal{M}_0 = \mathcal{M}\Sub{A} = 2.7$ from
equation~(99), one obtains $\mathcal{M}_1 = 0.54$,
$N_1 = 2.83 N_0 = 5.77 \times 10^4$\,cm$^{-3}$, $T_1 = 3.13 T_0 =
30,500$\,K, so that the density and temperature jump across the shock
are both roughly a factor of 3.

The emission from the cooling zone behind the shock can be crudely
approximated as the emission from a homogeneous layer with density
$N_1$ and temperature $T_1$ and with a width equal to the cooling time
$t\Sub{cool} = 3 k T_1 / \left( N_1 \Lambda_1 \right)$ multiplied by
the immediate post-shock velocity $v_1 = \mathcal{M}_1 (T_1/T_0)^{1/2}
c_0 \simeq 11.5$\,km\,s$^{-1}$. In order to estimate the cooling
coefficient $\Lambda_1$ in the cooling zone I calculated another
Cloudy model, identical to that mentioned above except that the
electron temperature was artificially maintained at $T\Sub{e} = T_1$.
The result was $\Lambda_1 = 4.46 \times
10^{-23}$\,erg\,cm$^{3}$\,s$^{-1}$, giving a cooling time $t\Sub{cool} =
4.9 \times 10^6$\,s and a cooling zone thickness $h\Sub{cool} = 5.64
\times 10^{12}$\,cm. Although the \ion{O}{3} optical lines are still
significant coolants in the cooling zone (20\% of total), they are now
supplanted in importance by the \ion{C}{3} NUV (28\%) and FUV (26\%)
lines.

\dots and that is all there is room for.
