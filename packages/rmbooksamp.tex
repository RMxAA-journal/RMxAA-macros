  These are the proceedings of a very nice conference that Jane and
  Pepe organised. This is the preface, which explains what a wonderful
  time was had by all and how grateful they are for all the people who
  gave them money or helped out.
  
  This is another paragraph of the preface, in case they have anything
  else to say.  For example, the Scientific Organizing Committee
  consisted of
  \begin{quote}
    J. Franco (Mexico, Chair), D. Cox (USA) and various other notables
  \end{quote}
  while the Local Organizing Committee comprised
  \begin{quote}
