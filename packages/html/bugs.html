    <h1>Known bugs for rmaa.cls</h1>

    <p> Please report any problems directly to <a
    href="mailto:w.henney@crya.unam.mx">me</a>. From time to time, I
    will release new corrected versions of the macros. In the mean
    time, corrections and work arounds will be posted here.  </p>
    

<h3> Versions 3.24b and earlier </h3>

<p>Error messages like:
<pre>
! LaTeX Error: Command \bibfont already defined.
              Or name \end... illegal, see p.192 of the manual.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
 ...

l.127 \newcommand\bibfont{\small}
</pre>
when compiling with recent versions of latex or when uploading to arxiv.org. Fixed in 3.25, which unfortunately took a long time to get posted to the website. Thanks to Roberto Vázquez, Grażyna Stasińska, Gary Ferland, Vladimir Ávila, Hector Aceves, and Luis Felipe Rodríguez for reporting this.

</p>

<h3> Any Recent Version </h3>

    <p>Error messages like
      <pre>
! LaTeX Error: Unknown option `longnamesfirst' for package `natbib'.
      </pre>
      or
      <pre>
! LaTeX Error: File `paralist.sty' not found.
      </pre>
      when compiling <tt>rm-extenso.tex</tt> or other files. This is not
      really a bug, it is just because you have a decade-old TeX set-up
      with out-of-date versions of some necessary style
      files. <b>Solution:</b> Update your TeX installation to a newer version.


    <h3> Version 3.08 </h3>

    <p>The example files no longer compile. Fixed in 3.09. Thanks to
      Bob O'Dell for spotting this.</p> 

    <h3> Version 2.1 </h3>

    <p>The page range doesn't get put in the header properly for
      one-page posters. Don't worry about this - it works fine when
      the poster is included in the full volume.</p> 

    <h3> Version 2.0 </h3>

    <p>The <tt>\ion</tt> command doesn't work very well. In fact, it
      never did - serves me right for copying it from the AAS
      macros. This is now fixed in version 2.1 with a super-duper
      <tt>\ion</tt> command that does the right thing in all
      conceivable circumstances (I hope).</p>

    <h3> Version 1.8 </h3>

    <p>The <tt>manuscript</tt> option doesn't work very well. The
      double-spacing and large margins can cause figure captions to go
      off the bottom of the page. I will fix this soon. Thanks to
      Leticia Carigi for pointing this out.</p>

    <h3> Version 1.4 </h3>

    Some people have had problems with the graphics commands when
    using an old version of LaTeX, which the macros were not designed
    to work with. There are two possible solutions:
    <ol>
      <li>Update your LaTeX installation</li>
      <li>Grab the latest version of the macros, which includes a
	subdirectory <tt>OLDLATEX/</tt> containing some style files
	which are absent in pre-1995 LaTeX versions. </li>
    </ol>
     

    <h3> Version 0.7 </h3>

    If you still have this version. you should <a href="rmaa.tar.gz">upgrade</a>. 

    <ol>
      <li>The line <pre>\usepackage[american]{babel}</pre> in
	<tt>rmaa.cls</tt> causes an
	error on some older (pre-1995) versions of LaTeX. <br> 
	<p>
	  Reported by Chris Mauche (<tt>mauche@cygnus.llnl.gov</tt>), 
	  1999/10/05</p>
	<p> <strong>Solution</strong> (1999/10/06): Comment out the offending
	  line: it is only necessary in rare cases. Alternatively,
	  browbeat your system administrator into updating your LaTeX installation.</p> </li>
    </ol>
